          Black Holes are one of the least understood yet most intriguing astronomical phenomena. Their intrigue caused Christopher Nolan an 
          American director to consult with Nobel prize winning astrophysicist Kip Thorne to create Interstellar. This movie is a study of 
          physics with many events being explored like time dilation, wormholes but mainly black holes. The movie’s black hole is named Gargantua
          a supermassive black hole at the centre of space exploration. This paper covers the cinematic CGI interpretation of a black hole and 
          the laws of physics compared to the truth.

          In 2014 Christopher Nolan directed Interstellar a Sci-Fi Space film, a large majority of the film involves scientist ‘Cooper’ and crew,
          exploring planets surrounding a supermassive black hole ‘Gargantua’. Throughout this paper I will investigate the question ‘To what extent 
          are black holes accurately depicted in the Sci-fi Blockbuster?’ comparing the CGI interpretation with real knowledge we have of black holes.

    <h3 id="Black Holes">Black Holes</h3>
    <p class="ex3">
      <pre>
          In the final stage of a supermassive star’s life, when the core finishes fusing matter the outside of the star explodes in a supernova (a 
          large gaseous cloud of matter) and the super dense core folds in on itself. This super volatile point in space, that pulls all other matter 
          around it inwards, is now a black hole with an extremely dense area called a singularity in the very heart. 

          The fundamentals of a black hole and what happens around it are done correctly in Interstellar, for example Gargantua pulls in anything close 
          by, like Cooper and TARS, and the effect of time dilation is a big struggle in the movie. Gargantua is designed like all black holes we 
          theorise in the way the CGI is structured. It consists of an accretion disk, event horizon then singularity in the centre. However, contrary 
          to common black holes the scale of Gargantua is much more massive than most black holes we observe. Sagittarius A* - the black hole at the 
          centre of the milky way – is 4.2x10^6 solar masses and is classed as ‘supermassive’, Gargantua is claimed by Thorne to be 100 million solar 
          masses, calculated this amount is approximately a mass of 1.96x10^38kg.

    <h3 id="Accretion Disks">Accretion Disks</h3>
    <p class="ex4">
      <pre>
          The light that surrounds Gargantua is an accretion disk, a flattened plane of matter continuously spiralling around. Taking circular motion
          into account, as the velocity of something caught inside the accretion disk increases the force upon it by gravity increases which in turn
          decreases the radius this is what causes a spiral inward with the final point being beyond the event horizon and eventually leading to the
          singularity. The movie accurately depicts this process as Coop enters the gravitational field of the black hole, he gets caught in the 
          swirling accretion disk before he falls past it into the singularity. 
       
          When a black hole is eating a star the centripetal acceleration of the matter is close to c, this means that due to the temperature of the 
          star as it speeds up, the emissions should appear a blue colour on the visible light spectrum as the wavelengths are stretched out. This 
          blue light would be visible in the accretion disk and as there is only white light in the CGI image, we can suggest it hasn’t consumed 
          anything in years and is therefore colder than expected. This means Gargantua is portrayed as hotter than other black holes like M87*
          - the accretion disk surrounding it is a red/orange suggesting it is cooler.
       
          As the accretion disk is so vast something the movie has incorrect is that Miller’s planet, the planet featured in figure 1, as it would 
          be closer too if not in the accretion disk. This would affect a lot of the movie’s plot on the planet as the path entry and exit would 
          require a slingshot around another body, as well as the visual aspect on the planet changing as the majority of the sky should covered by
          the event horizon, and a lot more by a bleeding white light.

    <h3 id="Singularities">Singularities</h3>
    <p class="ex5">
    <pre>
          The final major change made in the movie compared to what would occur in real life is the way in which Cooper goes into and out of Gargantua.
          Singularities are the centre of a black hole at which all the mass is concentrated and so the force of gravity is so strong it destroys our
          concept of spacetime. Once Cooper travels into the singularity there are three main plot lines that do not obey the laws of physics. 
          Firstly, anything that enters a black hole never leaves it and the movie suggests that there is a possibility someone could enter and exit one.
     
          However, this point is considered for the data TARS tries to transmit out of the black hole, the waves cannot get past the event horizon and
          infinitely bounce around inside the black hole, this would occur. Next there is the issue of spaghettification, as a singularity is a dense 
          concentration of mass the tidal gravitational forces felt by everything around it stretches all matter in the direction of the black hole 
          towards the singularity. Finally there is the issue of time, the tidal forces of gravity warp spacetime so heavily that it ceases to exist, 
          meaning Cooper would have no way to get back to his daughter if he could exit Gargantua.

    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex6">
    <pre>
          Interstellar presents black holes not as a mystery we don’t fully understand but as a beautiful creation we should be invested in. The 
          attention to detail and true physics behind a large majority of the movie is what makes it so interesting to viewers. I believe the removal
          of spaghettification, Miller’s planet’s true habitat and many other small details create a more pleasurable experience for the viewer however
          they limit the correctness of the movie. So in conclusion the sci-fi blockbuster does to quite a good extent well present the complex physics
          of a black hole, with a few minor switches.
