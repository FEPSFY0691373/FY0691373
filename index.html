<p class="ex2">
      <pre>
        Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent machine through 
        the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the 
        querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  
        improve  the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),
        Monte  Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  
        (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they 
        are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding
        the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the  current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is 
        to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has
        been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence
        to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).

 <h3 id="Black Holes">Black Holes</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
        In the final stage of a supermassive star’s life, when the core finishes fusing matter the outside of the star explodes in a supernova (a 
        large gaseous cloud of matter) and the super dense core folds in on itself. This super volatile point in space, that pulls all other matter 
        around it inwards, is now a black hole with an extremely dense area called a singularity in the very heart. 

        The fundamentals of a black hole and what happens around it are done correctly in Interstellar, for example Gargantua pulls in anything close 
        by, like Cooper and TARS, and the effect of time dilation is a big struggle in the movie. Gargantua is designed like all black holes we 
        theorise in the way the CGI is structured. It consists of an accretion disk, event horizon then singularity in the centre. However, contrary 
        to common black holes the scale of Gargantua is much more massive than most black holes we observe. Sagittarius A* - the black hole at the 
        centre of the milky way – is 4.2x10^6 solar masses and is classed as ‘supermassive’, Gargantua is claimed by Thorne to be 100 million solar 
        masses, calculated this amount is approximately a mass of 1.96x10^38kg.
